<h1>Franklin Richards</h1>

        In his reality, an invasion of Mad Celestials caused a collapse of it into a single timestream and Franklin,
        Valeria and Nathaniel Richards, were apparently, the only survivors in this reality close to extinction.
        He made a plan with Valeria and Nathaniel to save the reality,
        he traveled to Earth-616 and used his reality shifting powers to restore his past counterpart self's mutant
        abilities, as well as advising the past Valeria about things she has to do in order to save the future.

        After Nathaniel Richards battled his other counterparts in a game set by Immortus and remained as the last
        Reed Richards, Franklin forced him to travel back in time and help the Fantastic Four, at that time
        Future Foundation, to fight the alternate Reed Richards loose on Earth-616 and deal with the invasion
        of the Mad Celestials until he and Valeria could escape from the destruction of their reality and arrive
        to finish their plan. They arrived during Galactus battle against the Mad Celestials and, using his power,
        he teleported them into a gas giant, withstood direct assault and even killed one by himself.
        He then, with the help of his younger self's powers, was capable of reviving Galactus, who had been rendered
        unconscious in battle, and turned him into his herald which he then used to destroy the Celestials.
        After the reality was saved, Franklin shares a brief moment with Galactus; the two discuss the heat death
        of everything and the revelation of Franklin's immortality, specifically that he will, billions of years
        from now, stand beside Galactus to witness the birth of a new universe.

        Billions of years later, Franklin is seen with Galactus at the End of Time to witness the birth of the Ninth
        Cosmos. Franklin is meant to become the next Galactus and while they wait, Galactus chronicles the complete
        story of the Eighth Cosmos, revealing previously unknown secrets. In a potential timeline, both Franklin
        and Galactus were killed by the Immortal Hulk who also kills the last Homo Supreme, the ultimate evolution
        of mutants that was a backup in case Franklin was killed, thus becoming the only being left in the universe.
        When the Sentience of the Eighth Cosmos came to greet what he thought was Bruce Banner, he soon discovered
        that it was an elaborate trick put in motion by the One Below All, a malevolent entity that resides
        in the Below-Place, the deepest layer of Hell, which had possessed the Hulk and then quickly devoured
        the Sentience of the Eighth Cosmos and absorbed its power.
