  <h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>
  <P>
      A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t.
      So in order to be a superhero, you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human
      being could possess, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.
      <br>
      <br>
      Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. For instance,
      a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story.
      But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story.
      If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish,
      then I assume he becomes a superhero. The following essay by legendary comic book writer, editor, publisher,
      and producer

      Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City with assistance from various supporting characters, including his
      butler Alfred, police commissioner Jim Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin. Unlike most superheroes,
   ll   Batman does not possess any inhuman superpowers.
